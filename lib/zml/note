  # A similar effect can be had by the SQL query:
  # select e.path, ns.prefix, et.tag, e.content
  #   from elements e
  #   left join element_tags et on e.elemid = et.elemid
  #   left join namespaces ns on et.nsid = ns.nsid
  #   order by e.path;
# QUESTION:
# - are attributes element-specific? i.e. is a
#   <foo:chapter title="foo">
# different from a
#   <bar:section title="foo"> ?
# I am assuming that they are. Note that in both cases, 'title' is
# not associated with any namespace, even though the enclosing element is,
# or that there may be a default namespace in force.
# So what about
#   <chapter zml:wibble="true">
#   <section zml:wibble="true">
# are *those* two different attributes?
