Identity
--------
http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/xmlIDsemantics-32.html

 The desire of some people to have new ID-like types that are, for example,
 unique among elements of a give type, or unique in a particular namespace,
 or unique in a given subtree, are also not addressed in this document
 although it is appreciated that some of these new types would aid in
 composability. In particular, wrapper formats such as SOAP encoding benefit
 from having identifiers that are not in scope for the whole document, and
 which are only unique among attributes of the same name, such as
 soap-enc:id.

    <<yep: we definitely want RADIUS logins not to conflict with POP3
      logins, either because the elements are different, or the attributes
      containing the username are different>>

 Other limitations of existing XML IDness not addressed in this finding are
 the restriction to alphanumeric keys (so id="42" is currently invalid), the
 use of a string basetype (even without the XML NAME constraint, id="00042"
 will not match idref="42"), or the restriction to single keys.

    <<would be very helpful if the username could be the primary ID for
      a RADIUS service>>

This is a good summary. In addition, we have an additional identity value
(the 'path'), which could be made to fit XML ID criteria just by prefixing
with an alphanumeric character. It is unique across all documents stored
within a ZML database, and allocated by ZML at insertion time; i.e. it
cannot be chosen by the user, and in general it will be different if the
same XML fragment is inserted in another ZML database. We can expose this to
the user as a zml:path or zml:id attribute.
