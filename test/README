Run a full test suite as:

ruby test_sqlite.rb
ruby test_mysql.rb
... etc, depending on which database backend you have available. Modify
the parameters within this file as appropriate.

Individual tests which don't use the database can be run separately as long
as you put ../lib in the path, e.g.

ruby -I../lib path.rb
